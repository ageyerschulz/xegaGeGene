# The R script xegaGaGene.R

The directory xegaGaGene contains the implementation 
of the functions of the gene layer of binary coded genes of 
a genetic algorithm. 


The easiest installation is by using install.packages from R.

1. Linux:
Start R in the directory where you have stored xegaGaGene_0.0.0.1.tar.gz

> install.packages("xegaGaGene_0.0.0.1.tar.gz")

1. Windows:
Start R in the directory where you have stored xegaGaGene_0.0.0.1.zip

> install.packages("xegaGaGene_0.0.0.1.zip")

The R script xegaGaGene.R generates

1. the man pages of the package.
2. the pdf documentation of the package.
3. the compilation and installation of the package.
   (You  must adapt the variables path and pName
    in the script xegaGaGene.R:

    path<-"~/dev/iaa/genetic/xega/"
    pName<-"xegaGaGene"

    to the directory where you copy the package.

You need to install the R-package devtools for this R script.

There are two ways to use the code:

1. Change into the R directory which contains the code, start R and load all code files:

source("xegaGaGene.R")

Note that the package xegaGaGene provides the functions
of the gene layer of binary coded genes
the genetic algorithm sga of the family sgX.

Use the pdf-Manual! 

2. Adapt the path in xegaGaGene.R and install the library xegaGaGene:

Rscript xegaGaGene.R

Restart R and

library(xegaGaGene)

You get all elements of the package by

xegaGaGene::

and pressing the tabulator.

You get the man page by e.g 

?InitGene

or 

help(InitGene)

All examples given on a man page can be executed by

example(InitGene)

Note that man pages and examples are only available, if you install 
the package as a library.
